    "This notebook will make a few different learning models, incorporating varying degrees of stats. A basic model will assess only the stats from the \"simple\" section of `baseballstats.py` (ERA, BA, etc.). An intermediate model will add in the intermediate stats (the \"+ stats\", award count, etc). Finally, an advanced model will bring the advnaced stats section (bWAR and fWAR). A few other may be constructed if time allows, perhaps to compare how effective bWAR is vs fWAR."
